# Arrows

It's a game that has an idea similar to Redstone in Minecraft.

It has basic logic gates like AND, NOT, XOR, etc.

Work in progress...

## Technical details

At the moment, we are working on the CORE part, which is basically a library that will be used in future realizations. Our plans are to port this library to WASM and maybe other programming languages like C.
</br>
The next step is to make WASM bindings and a basic GUI using HTML+CSS+JS.
</br>
After this, we'll try to make this game multithreading and maybe even decentralized (a map will be calculated on several computers).
